                    Our mission is to bring warmth to the cold. You can easily donate your unwanted winter clothes and help our collection reach the underprivileged. It is important to wear winter clothes to help prevent hypothermia. Winter clothes can also help to protect you from the elements, such as wind, rain, and snow. This is important because exposure to the elements can make you feel colder and can also lead to health problems.
